Version Control with Git:
Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
ANSWER
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later thus crucial in managing code changes. Github enhances version control for developers by: 
1. Forking Repositories: Forking creates a copy of a project under your account. You can freely make changes without affecting the original repository.
2. Cloning Repositories: Cloning creates a local copy on your machine. Work on the codebase and push changes back to GitHub.
3. Branches and Pull Requests: Create branches for features or bug fixes. Commit changes, push to your fork, and make pull requests.
4. Conflict Resolution: Collaborate within pull requests to resolve conflicts.

Branching and Merging in GitHub:
What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
ANSWER
- Branches are features used in managing development tasks and maintaining a clean codebase.
- Here are some features that make branching important:
1. Isolation: Branches allow you to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
2. Collaboration: Developers can work on different tasks simultaneously in separate branches.
3. Clean History: Branches keep changes organized and prevent clutter in the main branch.
- Create a new branch from an existing one (usually the default branch).
- Work on your branch, make code changes, and commit them. Collaborate with others within the branch.
- When ready, open a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main branch.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
ANSWER
- A pull rrequest in GitHub is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. This facilitates for collaboration, code review, and transparent discussions before interating the changes into the main codebase. 
Creating a Pull Request:
Navigate to your repository on GitHub. Choose the branch containing your commits. Click Compare & pull request. Write a clear title and description, including context and any relevant links. Submit the pull request.
Reviewing a Pull Request:
Review the changes in the “Files changed” tab. Leave comments, suggest improvements, or approve the changes. Collaborate with the author to address feedback. Once approved, merge the pull request.

GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
ANSWER
This is a platform that is intergrated directly into GitHub repositories and allows one to automate workflows, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD), right from the repository.

Introduction to Visual Studio:
What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
ANSWER
Visual Studio is an IDE developed by Microsoft as a comprehensive tool that allows you to write, edit, debug, and build code for various platforms, including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.
Differences between Visual Studio and VS Code:
1. Visual Studio is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for software development. It provides robust features for writing, editing, debugging, and running code. It’s ideal for full-stack applications and enterprise-level projects1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code), on the other hand, is an extension-based code editor. It’s lightweight, simpler, and suitable for individual developers and smaller projects.
2. Visual Studio offers built-in support for languages like C#, .NET, C++, Python, and web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). VS Code comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, but you can extend it to code in any language by installing relevant extensions.
3. Visual Studio can be more complex and resource-intensive due to its full-fledged IDE capabilities. VS Code is lightweight and requires less disk space for installation.
